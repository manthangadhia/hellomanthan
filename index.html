						<span class="greeting">Hi, I'm</span>
						<span class="name">Manthan</span>
					</h1>
					<p>
						I'm currently finishing up my
						<a href="https://istp.ethz.ch/" target="_blank">
							MSc Science, Technology, and Policy
						</a>
						at ETH Zürich, in the
						<a href="https://gess.ethz.ch/en/" target="_blank">
							Department of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences </a
						>.
					</p>
					<p>
						My previous education has placed me at the intersection of computer-
						and data-science, and the social sciences. Coming from an interdisciplinary
						BSc programme, I have continued in a similar vein.
					</p>
					<p>
						Throughout my master's education, I have developed an interest in
						thinking about matters of social justice in the "Age of AI,"
						focusing specifically on social outcomes in labour and education.
						You can find relevant pieces
						<a href="#writing">I have written</a> on topics I am interested in!
					</p>
					<p>
						I am generally passionate about language and have been fascinated
						with NLP tools, and recently also LLMs as a new advent for us to
						make sense of all the language-data that our society produces. I
						am of a passionate conviction that these tools can find relevant, 
						well-designed, and overall thoughtful uses in education and public 
						politics. If you have ideas you would like to share or just chat
						with me about these things, feel free to write me an email!
					</p>
					<p>
						Here's a list of personality traits in no particular order:
						<span class="personality">
							Likes to drink chai and coffee. Is social, thinks about technology
							and society, and listens to spacy music. Reads, programmes, does
							science, plays chess, passionate about knowledge and education,
							listens to philosophy podcasts, watches films when time allows,
							and thinks highly of railway.

					<h2>Experience</h2>
					<p>For my current CV, <a href="resume.html">click here!</a></p>
					<p>
						I did an internship at the Centre for AI and Robotics at UNICRI
						(United Nations Crime and Justice Research Institute) in The Hague
						in 2023. As part of this, I spent time helping build, maintain, and
						communicate insights about the
						<em> AI for Safer Children </em>
						platform focused on providing relevant, cutting-edge tools to those
						working on the frontlines fighting online child abuse.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have held many positions as a teaching-, student-, or
						research-assistant within university settings. From helping with
						organising courses, conducting exercise sessions, or doing admin
						work for my current student job at the

						While being at ETH Zürich, I have also engaged in community-building
						efforts on campus through being an organising member of the Debug
						Society Film Festival.
