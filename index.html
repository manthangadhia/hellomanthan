						<span class="greeting">Hi, I'm</span>
						<span class="name">Manthan</span>
					</h1>
					<p>
						I'm currently finishing up my
						<a href="https://istp.ethz.ch/" target="_blank">
							MSc Science, Technology, and Policy
						</a>
						at ETH Zürich, in the
						<a href="https://gess.ethz.ch/en/" target="_blank">
							Department of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences </a
						>.
					</p>
					<p>
						My previous education has placed me at the intersection of computer-
						and data-science, and the social sciences. Coming from an interdisciplinary
						BSc programme, I have continued in a similar vein.
					</p>
					<p>
						Throughout my master's education, I have developed an interest in
						thinking about matters of social justice in the "Age of AI,"
						focusing specifically on social outcomes in labour and education.
						You can find relevant pieces
						<a href="blog.html">I have written</a> on topics I am interested in!
					</p>
					<p>
						I am generally passionate about language and have been fascinated
						with NLP tools, and recently also LLMs as a new advent for us to
						make sense of all the language-data that our society produces. I
						am of a passionate conviction that these tools can find relevant, 
						well-designed, and overall thoughtful uses in education and public 
						politics. Not to forget information retrieval! If you have ideas 
                        you would like to share or just chat with me about these things, 
                        feel free to write me an email!
					</p>
					<p>
						Here's a list of personality traits in no particular order:
						<span class="personality">
							Likes to drink chai and coffee. Is social, thinks about technology
							and society, and listens to spacy music. Reads, programmes, does
							science, plays chess, passionate about knowledge and education,
							listens to philosophy podcasts, watches films when time allows,
							and thinks highly of railway.
