## `hellomanthan` is my personal webpage 
where I record, and share information about me, my interests, and the things I am working on.

This is expected to be a fairly straight-forward webpage with no (or rather, minimal) frills, primarily with a simple html and css base. I may include javascript features if I get around to learning js.

Here I also plan to maintain a small blog, although I may eventually consider moving it to an entirely separate url if I feel that its necessary and the structure of the site does nto allow for a blog or if I feel I simply want a different way to be able to link to it for people to see.
