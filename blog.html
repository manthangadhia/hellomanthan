                You will find here a variety of texts I've written. I am constantly trying to maintain a habit of thinking <em>through</em> 
                writing even though it keeps being much easier to only think.
            </p>
            <h3>Science fiction</h3>
            <p>
                I like to write science-fiction and find short stories fun to think through, for now there is just the one in an easily shareable 
                format that I wrote for the ETH Polykum (student magazine): 
                <a href="https://polykum.ch/issues/all-that-can-be-known/"><em>All that can be known.</em></a>
            </p>
            <h3>Thinking through my thesis</h3>
            Here you will see some notes I make about concepts I learn and ideas I come upon along the way.
