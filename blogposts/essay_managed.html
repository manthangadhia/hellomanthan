			<h2>Managed by AI, not replaced</h2>
			<p class="subtitle">Manthan Gadhia, June 2025</p>
			<p>
				The normative concerns which define the discussion around
				<i>labour justice</i> in the context of <i>automation</i> focus on the
				possibility of so-called low-skilled jobs being &#x201c;automated
				away.&#x201d; Core examples often cited to make this argument are
				familiar to us: think of factory workers replaced by robots, or
				delivery/taxi drivers replaced by self-driving cars, or food deliverers
				replaced by delivery drones, etc, with almost exclusively
				<i>low-skilled</i> jobs at <i>high-risk of automation</i>. In 2025, many
				such proclamations by techno-enthusiasts or warnings by
				techno-pessimists throughout the 2010s have not come to fruition, and do
				not seem to me like they will soon. Yet, we keep letting those examples
				and non-existent technologies shape our discussions. In this essay, I
				would like to show that normative concerns of
				<i>labour injustice</i> focusing on the challenges of a post-work world
				are incomplete in their assessment of the problem at-hand considering
				the way AI systems are transforming work in our society in 2025.
			</p>
			<p>
				This essay first contextualises our Western understanding of Work as
				conforming to a singular- reality perspective through the framework
				outlined by Law it then decomposes the notion of Work in society as
				defined by the opportunities for (social)
				<i>contribution and cooperation </i>(Celentano, 2019, 2023) offered to
				workers. Finally, I argue that considering the current state AI
				technology impacting contemporary workplaces, a more prescient
				<i>labour injustice</i> requires attention: not that low-skilled workers
				will be replaced, but that they will be managed by algorithmic systems
				in a continued trend of stripping worker autonomy through
				&#x201c;Scientific management&#x201d; practices (Birnbaum &amp; Somers,
				2022). This essay will not address strategies to overcome algorithmic
				management but rather will focus on framing it as the core, underlying
				labour injustice concern to attend to.
			</p>
			<h3>Work as nature</h3>
			<p>
				Law (2015) explores a way of thinking about the contingent, intersecting
				existence of <i>multiple realities</i> being enacted simultaneously
				around the world, and calls this the Fractiverse. He introduces this
				notion to juxtapose the dominant perspectives of Western technology and
				science, which largely function under the assumption of the existence of
				a <i>singular reality</i>. This perspective, he argues, is deeply
				embedded within our culture to the extent that we fail to truly accept
				other (people&#x2019;s) realities and that even the &#x201c;liberal and
				respectful&#x201d; among us are happy to &#x201c;let others have their
				own beliefs&#x201d; while still implicitly dismissing the possibility of
				multiple co-existing realities. Law draws our attention to a dichotomy
				that arises within our current singular-reality view, consisting of
				&#x201c;Nature&#x201d; on the one hand, and &#x201c;Culture&#x201d; on
				the other, where the &#x201c;natural&#x201d; is viewed as being driven
				by <i>impersonal, objective, </i>and<i> general forces.</i><i> </i>
			</p>
			<p>
				I want to argue, then, that the dominant understanding of Work in
				Western technoscience relegates it to a <i>naturalised</i> form where it
				is subject to being driven by external, and impersonal forces. Work is
				therefore perceived in-terms of an
				<i>exact expected enactment</i> (using prescribed techniques, processes,
				and goals) which can be operationalised through efficiency metrics,
				productivity targets, and algorithmic organisation&#x2014;all of which
				benefit from the use of labour- surveillance. Any deviation from the
				prescribed methodology on part of the human labourer (e.g., through
				personal preferences, shortcuts, personal rhythms, and so on) is seen as
				an inefficiency/deviation which needs to be corrected. Briefly, that is to
				say the (manager&#x2019;s) singular reality of work is strictly imposed,
				squashing all other enactable realities of work.
			</p>
			<p>
				While staying within the <i>nature/culture</i> dichotomy&#x2014;which is
				still subject to Law&#x2019;s critiques of the single-reality
				model&#x2014;a <i>denaturalised </i>work would be characterised by
				factors which are not only subjective to each individual labourer, but
				are inherently complex, social, and contextual. This could stand in
				opposition to a natural work which is seen as a means to efficiently use
				human resources to extract value from other resources.
			</p>
			<h3>Work as contribution</h3>
			<p>
				To understand how naturalised work is truly impacted by the developments
				of AI- and other digital technologies, I would like to first define
				<i>Work.</i> Borrowing from Celentano (2019), work can be understood as
				way individuals participate in <i>social cooperation</i> and
				<i>contribute</i> to the collective functioning of- and value-creation
				in society. This definition allows us to centre the human labourer and
				their role in the system rather than viewing work as an abstract journey
				to self-realisation or automation. This reframing is crucial to
				understand work through the lenses of &#x201c;contributive
				inequality&#x201d; and &#x201c;contributive agency.&#x201d;
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Contributive inequality</i> (Celentano, 2019) is a hierarchical
				distinction between the contributively advantaged and disadvantaged. The
				former of whom are typically those we consider
				&#x201c;high-skilled&#x201d; or &#x201c;professionals&#x201d; and whose
				jobs are often characterised as being &#x2018;rewarding, challenging,
				creative, innovative,&#x2019; and any tasks they may have which fall
				outside of this umbrella are easily outsourced&#x2014;to another person
				or machine. The jobs of the advantaged are also highly conducive to
				opportunities of self-development, -expression, and - determination,
				affording them significant autonomy and decision-making authority in
				their enactment of work. When their work is outsourced, this often
				results in the worker attaining greater autonomy and wealth for becoming
				more efficient at overseeing value-extraction. On the other side of the
				hierarchy would be the <i>contributively</i> <i>disadvantaged</i>, the
				so-called &#x201c;non- professionals&#x201d; whose work does not afford
				them the same opportunities for self-development, -expression, or
				-determination. They are instead the ones typically taking the
				&#x2018;unrewarding, dull, uncreative&#x2019; jobs, having little say
				over the contributive role they play in the value-creation process.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Contributive agency</i> (Celentano, 2023) can then be understood as
				that agentic capacity for self- determination a worker has over the
				&#x201c;content, form, and terms of their contribution.&#x201d; The
				degree to which any given labourer can exercise this agency is not an
				absolute characteristic, but by Celentano&#x2019;s argument is an
				&#x201c;organisationally mediated capacity.&#x201d; Therefore, this
				capacity is defined as existing over 4 key-dimensions, each of which can
				be realised on a spectrum rather than as an all-or-nothing achievement.
				The relevant dimensions for my argument include: the relational
				(allowing workers to connect with one-another and meaningfully
				cooperate), and the participatory (where workers have an active role in
				shaping work-rules and decision-making processes).
			</p>
			<p>
				Within our normative understanding of work as natural, this contributive
				hierarchy is taken as a given and the active efforts made to better
				enact work (i.e., to improve efficiency, productivity, and labour output
				from the workers) has resulted in a growing trend of Algorithmic
				Management (AM) techniques being adopted in workplaces to make autonomous
				managerial decisions, and I posit that these techniques have a
				constraining effect on the agentic capacities afforded to the
				contributively disadvantaged.
			</p>
			<h3>A deeper injustice</h3>
			<p>
				Normative concerns of labour injustice in the age of AI have focused on
				the fact that the contributively disadvantaged will lose access to work
				opportunities and suffer economically as a result. The
				&#x201c;low-skilled&#x201d; nature of their job has been taken, in a
				technologically deterministic sense, to imply that the jobs will be
				automated. The primary remedy for this state of affairs is to implement
				a Universal Basic Income of sorts, however this approach perpetuates the
				existence of a contributive hierarchy and reduces work to a matter of
				income (naturalisation), removing it from its broader social context (as
				an opportunity for workers to contribute to their communities).
			</p>
			<p>
				This, I argue, is an incomplete assessment of the scope of labour
				justice concerns&#x2014;it only acknowledges the contributive hierarchy
				and therefore cannot meaningfully ameliorate the challenges faced by
				workers. A more thorough understanding must account for the manner in
				which the contributive agency afforded to labourers informs their
				position in the hierarchy (and perhaps the existence of such a hierarchy
				in the first place).
			</p>
			<p>
				To better understand the challenges faced by labourers, one must move on
				from discussions of delivery drones, self-driving taxis, and factory
				robots, because the jobs these idealised technologies claim to replace
				are not going to disappear anytime soon. The techno-optimist sales
				pitches throughout the 2010s fundamentally misunderstood the human
				complexities of the activities undertaken within our societies. However,
				this does not mean that no advances were made in AI technologies aimed
				at workplace improvements in the last decade, rather just that the
				developments have been less &#x2018;science fiction&#x2019; in nature.
				Take for example Amazon&#x2019;s SCOT (Supply Chain Optimisation
				Technologies) system, designed to be the &#x201c;nervous system&#x201d;
				of the Amazon store, and being responsible for orchestrating the
				company&#x2019;s entire supply- chain (Graham et al., 2024, pp.
				113-138). SCOT is described as an &#x201c;extraction machine&#x201d;
				which &#x201c;centralises knowledge and decision-making,&#x201d; and
				operates &#x201c;quietly in the background&#x201d; to &#x201c;optimise
				critical functions,&#x201d; and that it makes use of extensive
				data-driven optimisation and productivity monitoring processes to
				achieve this goal.
			</p>
			<h3>Algorithmic boss</h3>
			<p>
				Using data and surveillance to optimise labour output is not a new
				phenomenon and has at least a century-long history in Taylorism, which
				emerged in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century
				aiming to improve economic efficiency and labour productivity in
				factories through &#x201c;scientifically&#x201d; identifying optimal
				workflows and enforcing them through managerial control (Birnbaum &amp;
				Somers, 2022). SCOT, representing these Taylorist principles, can have
				extensive control over workers, for example it can assign tasks to
				workers based on the muscle groups involved in completing said task and
				build a shift rotation to maximise productive output, set a baseline
				rate for how fast tasks should be completed by a given worker,
				constantly observe them, and even make decisions about firing workers
				who fail to meet their set targets (Graham et al., 2024).
			</p>
			<p>
				Under naturalised work, these developments follow logically as
				capital-owners strive to maximise the productive output from their human
				labourers as well as the overall value extracted from all available
				resources. The development and deployment of such systems serves to
				actively add more constraints to the degree of contributive agency a
				worker is afforded, and these further cement their position on the lower
				rung of Celentano&#x2019;s contributive hierarchy.
			</p>
			<p>
				I would like to note that the impact on workers is not equally shared
				across the globe and can be further problematised through considering
				geographic divisions along the Global North and South. In their book,
				Graham et al. (2024, pp. 113-138) follow a British Amazon warehouse
				worker who spends nearly his entire workday in isolation from other
				workers, taking instructions from SCOT (delivered through human
				managers) and has his work heavily controlled, leaving him nearly no
				exercisable agency in his enactment of his work. On the other hand,
				however, we can consider similarly controlling strategies being used in
				the Global South for a more perverse aim. I would like to take the
				example of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) firm Sama (Muldoon et al.,
				2023) where data workers are subjected algorithmic management, with the
				aim to optimise their labour output to provide the data necessary to
				build, operate, and maintain AI systems like SCOT. Neither Sama workers
				nor Amazon warehouse workers are at immediate risk of replacement by AI,
				however they are dehumanised and orchestrated by AI systems as if a cog
				in a machine.
			</p>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>
				To meaningfully address concerns of labour injustice in the age of AI,
				our discussions need to move beyond technological determinism and
				instead contend with the reality of AI systems transforming the way work
				is done and experienced in society. Work will persist, however the core
				challenge for us is to ensure it is conducted humanely and that our
				normative discussions consider the inherent social aspects of work and
				workers.

			<h3>AI usage disclaimer</h3>
			<p>
				For this essay, I made minimal use of AI-aids. Here are the two cases
				where I made use of it:
			</p>
			<ol>
			<li>
				I used Google&#x2019;s NotebookLM to read John Law&#x2019;s text to
				help answer a question for me about the way I wanted to frame my thesis statement on his framework.
				Here is the singular interaction I had: </li>

			<p>
				Me: I want to tie the idea of a one-world view to the way workers are
				treated in increasingly automated work environments: think of amazon
				warehouse workers who are increasingly monitored by cameras and other
				surveillance technology as if they were machines. This, I want to argue,
				is fundamentally a view of capital-owners (including labour as a capital
				resource) as seeing everything as a monetary-value generator, i.e., a
				flawed one-world view. What are some critiques of my perspective based
				on Law&apos;s text?
			</p>
			<p>
				Notebook LM: Your perspective, which links the treatment of Amazon
				warehouse workers &quot;as if they were machines&quot; to a &quot;flawed
				one-world view&quot; of capital owners, offers a compelling starting
				point for analysis through the lens of John Law&apos;s work [User
				Query]. Law&apos;s text, however, might offer several critiques of
				framing it simply as a &quot;flawed&quot; view, instead pushing for a
				more nuanced understanding of how realities are actively
				&quot;done&quot; or &quot;enacted&quot;.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are some critiques of your perspective, based on Law&apos;s
				arguments:
			</p>
			<p>
				&#x2022;
				<b
					>The &quot;Flawed&quot; View is an Active &quot;Enactment,&quot; Not
					Just a Misconception:</b
				>
			</p>
			<p>
				<tt>o</tt> Law would argue that the capital owners&apos; view of
				everything, including labour, as a &quot;monetary-value generator&quot;
				is not merely a conceptual flaw or a mistaken belief, but rather a
				<b>powerful &quot;enactment&quot; of a specific reality</b>. This
				&quot;one-world&quot; view, which distinguishes between nature and
				culture, is &quot;indeed an enactment and only partial&quot;.
			</p>
			<p>
				<tt>o</tt> For Law, realities &quot;are enacted in practices&quot;.
				Therefore, the treatment of Amazon workers as if they were machines,
				constantly monitored by surveillance technology, is not just a
				perception but a
				<b
					>concrete way in which a particular reality of the worker is
					&quot;done&quot; or &quot;made to be&quot;</b
				>
				in those specific work environments. The Eurobarometer survey case study
				illustrates how surveys &quot;enact&quot; a specific kind of person
				(e.g., arithmetically competent, possessing stable attitudes), thereby
				&quot;making the survey person what she is&quot;. Similarly, the Amazon
				system &quot;enacts&quot; a worker primarily as a predictable,
				measurable unit for value generation.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#x2022;
				<b
					>The Nature/Culture Divide and &quot;Disqualification&quot; of Human
					Agency:</b
				>
			</p>
			<p>
				<tt>o</tt> Your observation that workers are treated &quot;as if they
				were machines&quot; ties directly into Law&apos;s discussion of the
				<b
					>Northern metaphysical settlement, which historically established a
					rigid division between &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;culture&quot;</b
				>. In this settlement, nature is seen as driven by impersonal,
				objective, and general forces, while the social/cultural is
				characterised by human (or collective) forms of agency that are
				intentional and variable.
			</p>
			<p>
				<tt>o</tt> By treating workers like machines, the system attempts to
				<b>relegate them to the &quot;nature&quot; side of this division</b>,
				where their actions are expected to be governed by impersonal, quantifiable processes (like algorithms and efficiency
				metrics) rather than the messy, unpredictable domain of human
				subjectivity and agency. This practice actively
				<b
					>&quot;disqualifies&quot; the workers&apos; multi-faceted human
					reality</b
				>
				and privileges a singular, machine-like one. Robert Boyle&apos;s
				establishment of scientific &quot;technologies of truth&quot;
				historically created this &quot;double division&quot; where
				&quot;serious reality work&quot; (the &quot;natural&quot; world)
				excluded the political and social dimensions of human agents.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#x2022;
				<b
					>&quot;One-World&quot; as a Contingent Achievement, Not a Universal
					Given:</b
				>
			</p>
			<p>
				<tt>o</tt> Law argues that the belief in a single, overarching reality
				(a &quot;universe&quot;) is not a natural state but a
				<b>&quot;contingent achievement&quot;</b>. Even within the &quot;heart
				of Western technoscience,&quot; multiple realities are constantly being
				dealt with and &quot;patched together&quot;.
			</p>
			<p>
				<tt>o</tt> The &quot;monetary-value generator&quot; view, when enforced
				through automation and surveillance, is a powerful attempt to
				<b>impose and maintain a singular reality</b> within the warehouse
				environment by partially &quot;repressing difference&quot;. It is an
				effort to make the &quot;one-world&quot; of capital-driven efficiency
				rule, despite the inherent &quot;ontological multiplicity&quot; of human
				workers. The coherence of this singular reality is a &quot;contingent
				business&quot; that requires active work to suppress alternative
				realities.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#x2022; <b>Critique Itself Can Reinforce One-World Metaphysics:</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				<tt>o</tt> Law offers a crucial meta-critique:
				<b
					>even efforts to challenge a &quot;one-world metaphysics&quot; can
					paradoxically reinforce it</b
				>. If your argument, in critiquing the &quot;flawed one-world
				view,&quot; implies that workers are <i>really</i> something else (e.g.,
				inherently creative, autonomous, non-monetary value-generating beings),
				it risks falling into the trap of simply asserting a
				<i>different singular reality</i> about what people are
				&quot;like&quot;.
			</p>
			<p>
				<tt>o</tt> Law suggests that such criticism, while well-intentioned, can
				&quot;embed and enact one-world doctrines&quot; by asserting a different
				definitive &quot;reality&quot; about people. Instead, Law advocates for
				recognizing and &quot;wrestling with the implications that worlds in the
				plural are enacted in different and power-saturated practices&quot;. The
				aim, for Law, is to &quot;find ways of levering open Northern
				multiplicities&quot; rather than replacing one singular truth with
				another.
			</p>
			<p>
				In essence, Law&apos;s framework suggests that your argument could be
				strengthened by moving beyond the idea of a &quot;flawed view&quot; to
				explore how the capital-driven system actively
				<b
					>enacts, sustains, and enforces a specific, singular reality of the
					worker</b
				>, often by suppressing or disqualifying their other, multiple realities
				through the very practices of automation and surveillance you describe.

				2. I made use of ChatGPT to suggest a rewrite for a paragraph which was
				very wordy, and
			</p>
			<p>made use of some of its suggestions:</p>
			<p>
				Me: I am working on an essay and I have a paragraph that I wrote which I
				think can be a bit more concise, can you help me and suggest minimal changes to make it concise
				and easier to read? &quot;This essay is structured so as to first
				contextualise our Western understanding of Work as conforming to a
				singular-reality perspective through the framework outlined by Law
				(2015). I follow this by further decomposing the notion of Work in
				society as defined by the opportunities for (social) contribution and
				cooperation (Celentano, 2019, 2023) offered to workers. Finally, I would
				like to make the argument that considering the ways in which current AI
				technology is impacting contemporary workplaces, a more prescient labour
				injustice requires attention: not how to keep low-skilled jobs around,
				but how they will be managed by algorithmic systems in a continued trend
				of stripping worker autonomy through &#x201c;Scientific
				management&#x201d; practices (Birnbaum &amp; Somers, 2022). This essay
				will not address strategies to overcome algorithmic management but
				rather will focus on framing it as the core, underlying labour injustice
				concern to attend to.&quot;
			</p>
			<p>
				ChatGPT: Here&#x2019;s a tightened version of your paragraph, with
				minimal but targeted edits to improve clarity and flow:
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;This essay first contextualises the Western understanding of Work
				as shaped by a singular- reality perspective, drawing on Law&#x2019;s
				(2015) framework. It then decomposes Work as a social construct, defined
				by the opportunities for contribution and cooperation offered to workers
				(Celentano, 2019, 2023). Finally, I argue that amid the growing
				influence of AI in workplaces, the more urgent labour injustice is not
				the preservation of low-skilled jobs, but their management by
				algorithmic systems&#x2014;a continuation of autonomy-stripping
				&#x201c;Scientific management&#x201d; practices (Birnbaum &amp; Somers,
				2022). This essay does not propose solutions to algorithmic management,
				but instead frames it as the central labour injustice requiring
				attention.&quot;

				Let me know if you want it made sharper, more formal, or more polemical.
