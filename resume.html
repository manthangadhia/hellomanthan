			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				I'm a Master's student of Science, Technology, and Policy at ETH Zürich,
				with a focus on computer- and data-science. I have a keen interest in the 
                intersection of politics and society, and information technologies leveraging
                developments in science.
			</p>
            <p>
                I come from an interdisciplinary bachelor's education training me in the 
                theoretical and technical foundations of AI with its developmental roots in
                cognitive science alongside an introduction to technology ethics. My academic
                interests lie in developing my knowledge of technology ethics, the interactions 
                and impacts of (social) technologies on out socio-political landscapes, and the 
                role education can play in the way technologies may be designed for social progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon completing my master's degree, I seek an interesting opportunity to apply
                my skills at the intersection digital technologies and their social impacts. I 
                am open to pursuing a career where I will continue to learn, in private industry
                or academia.
            </p>
